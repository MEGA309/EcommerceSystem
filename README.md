In this System I created a superclass "Product" that inherits 3 sub classes ( Booking Product, Electronic Product,Clothing Product)
Then a class that represents a customer with attributes like customerId, name, and address 
Then a class that can add product to the cart by using an an array to add in it , remove an object from this array ,Calculate the price of every object in this array by using for each method and a method called placeOrder with attributes like customerId, nProducts, and products array.
Then the order class that have a method to print the order information (printOrderinfo) with attributes like customerId, orderId, products array, and totalPrice.
I created an object from each subclass of the superclass "Product" 
creating products, customers, and orders based on user input
By running the System:
Creates  electronic, clothing, and book products
Creates a customer and a shopping cart for the customer
Asks the user to input the number of products they want to order and adds them to the cart
Prompts the user to place an order and prints order information
